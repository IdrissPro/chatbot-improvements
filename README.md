A production-grade multi-modal RAG stack combining OCR, LLM + VLM reasoning, hybrid retrieval, and GraphRAG-inspired KG/embedding context selection. Includes reward-style fine-tuning + RL post-training (RLHF) under low-data constraints, plus automated eval (human feedback + metrics + LLM-as-judge) and scalable PyTorch training pipelines.
